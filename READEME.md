# Bank Management System

A simple console-based Bank Management System developed in C++. It supports customer management, account creation, transaction recording, and undo functionality using basic data structures like vectors and stacks.

## 📁 Project Description

This system allows bank staff to:
- Add new customers with personal details.
- Create and link bank accounts to customers.
- View customer and account details.
- Record deposits and withdrawals.
- Undo the last transaction for any account.
- List accounts associated with a specific customer.

It provides a clean interface and basic data validation while demonstrating structured programming, modular design, and usage of data structures such as vectors and stacks.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).
2. Clone the repository or download the `.cpp` file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-management-system.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory and compile:
   ```bash
   g++ -o bank Project\( Bank\ Management\ \).cpp
   ```

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

Once compiled, run the program from the terminal:
```bash
./bank
```

## 💡 Usage Example

- Choose `1` to add a new customer.
- Then choose `2` to create an account and link it to a customer.
- Use `5` to deposit or withdraw money.
- Use `6` to undo the last transaction.
- View customers (`3`) or accounts (`4`) as needed.

## 🧼 Notes

- Make sure to enter valid input types when prompted (e.g., numbers for balance).
- The system uses in-memory storage (no file/database support).
- Ideal for academic purposes or learning C++ data structures.
